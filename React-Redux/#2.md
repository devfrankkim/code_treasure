# How to start your project with React

How to install React-app 
1. ```npm install -g create-react-app <name of project>```
2. ```npx create-react-app <name of project>```   
So essentially if you take this route right here you run one command instead of two.
X is a command line tool that only started to be installed with versions of NPM from version five point two and higher.   
   

npm => runs npm
install => we want to install a package onto our computers
-g => installs this package globablly so we can run it from the terminal
creatae-react-app => name of the package we want to install
