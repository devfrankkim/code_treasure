### What is React and its purpose?

React is a JavaScript library.  
React's ultimate purpose is to show content(HTML) to users and handle user iteration.

### Why didn't we have to use Redux to make that app?

React can work by itself.
but it can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries, packages, servers, and databases

### What was that 'class' thing? what is Components

A JavaScript 'class'
React 'Components' are made using either JavaScript *functions or *classes

### What was the HTML looking stuff?

JSX => JavaScript + XML
JSX is used to determine the content of our React application just like normal
HTML does

A single Component is going to be used to create some amount of HTML and have that HTML show up on the screen

### How did the screen change when we moved the mouse?

We can also use a Component to create something called an event handler. Event handlers are used to somehow detect when a user is interacting with our app by clicking or dragging or typing or whatever it might be.

We can then use that event handler to somehow update our application or update our Component and show some slightly different content on the screen.

### Why did we add TWO libraries (React and ReactDOM)?

React is split into two separate libraries.  
React knows what a Component is and how to make Components work together.  
ReactDOM knows how to take a Component and make it show up in the DOM.
