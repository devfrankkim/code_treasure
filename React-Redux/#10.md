# Component

Component Nesting  
A Component can be shown inside of another

Component Reusability  
We want to make Components that can be easily reused through out application

1. identify the JSX that appears to be duplicated
2. what's the purpose of the block of JSX? Think of a descriptive name for what it does.
3. Create a new file to house this new Component - it should have the same name as the Component
4. Create a new Component in the new file, paste the JSX into it
5. Make the new Component configurable by using React's 'props' system

Component Configuration  
We should be able to configure a Component when it is created.
