# Check dev tool to check JSX | Objects are not valid as a React child.

*Objects are not valid as a React child.      
So clearly we can use javascript Objects as long as we're not trying to print them up as text or something like that inside of our application.    

```
const App = () => {
  const buttonText = { text: "Click me" };
  const style = { backgroundColor: "blue", color: "white" }
  const labelText = 'Enter name'

  return (
    <div>
      <label class="label" for="name">
        {labelText}
      </label>
      <input id="name" type="text" />
      <button style={style}>
        {buttonText.text}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```    

How to check if it's html or JSX    
check Developer tool    
    
React is going to look at all the different properties you are passing to elements inside of your JSX blocks.    
     
if there's warning, it will show up on dev tool.    
ex)     
```<label className="label" htmlFor="name">```

For word right here an incorrectly interpreted as a traditional javascript for loop like this.
