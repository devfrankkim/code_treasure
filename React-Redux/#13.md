1. Component2 is passing his props to PARENT Component1 a={a}, b={b} c={b}
2. Now, Component1 has 'props.children' given from Component2
   a={a}, b={b}, c={c}
3. You can finally show the Component2 PROPS on the screen inside Component1 with 'props.children'

ex)

1. A Company bought a small Company B.
2. B Company now needs to share their people, pens, papers, documents, data to A Company
3. A Company now can use B company's stuff with saying it is from 'props.children'
