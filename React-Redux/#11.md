#Props(properties) || JavaScript variables(JSX)
System for passing data from a parent Component to a child Component  
=>  
Goal is to customize or configure a child Component

1. Providing props from parent to child

2. Consume the information

**_App.js_**

```
<CommentDetail author="Sammy" />
* author => Name of the prop
* "Sammy" => Value of the prop
```

all you have to do is provide some information from the parent to the child by adding an attribute and then in the child you will reference the prop's argument.

It is an Object that contains the information that you provided from the parent. and then you will refer to that Prop inside of your JSX

Put in curly braces to indicate them about to reference a **_javascript variable_**

**_CommentDetail.js_**

```
const CommentDetail = props => {
  console.log(props); // Object
  return (
      <div className="content">
        <a href="/" className="author">
          {props.author}
        </a>
        <div className="text">Nice!</div>
      </div>
  );
};
```
