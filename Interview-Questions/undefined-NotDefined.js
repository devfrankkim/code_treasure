// undefined is like taking some memory
// Not defined is not even in the memory.

// === HOWEVER, undefined doeson't mean it is empty ===
// JavaScript is a loosley typed language -> types are flexible

// Never do this
var a = undefined;

// this is a keyword in JavaScript, it is a bad thing to do in JavaScript
// what is undefined?
// it's like a placeholder which is kept inside the variables for memory and it's for a specific purpose
