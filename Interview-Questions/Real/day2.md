### what is scope?

- In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope.
- Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name.
- Only code inside that function can access that function's scoped variables.
- A variable name has to be unique within the same scope. A scope can be nested inside another scope.
- If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.
