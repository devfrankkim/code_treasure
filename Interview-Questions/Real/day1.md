// Non-strict code...
//Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context.
// This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.

// ("use strict");

// Assignment to a non-writable global
var undefined = 5; // throws a TypeError
