### What's the difference between Host objects and Native objects?

- Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification, such as String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function, etc.

- Host objects are provided by the runtime environment (browser or Node),
  such as window, XMLHTTPRequest, etc.
