# Fork

Doesn't hurt the original account's projects AND you can fork the project to your repository and play with them.

# Pull Request

If you have beautiful projects, and you can pull request to original project. and Original projects can accept or reject
(asking original projects like "Would you please pull my projects?" because you can't push them to the original without permission.)

#GH pages

put all the files in a branch
which is gh-pages

if you put them on the branch,
then it will show up on your github page URL

create new branch

1. "gh-pages"
2. publish branch // push to origin.

master is the default branch
and the name needs to be "gh-pages"

get github pages domain
username.github.io/name-of-the-project

if you want to edit some files

1. master branch로 변경
2. commit to master

master doesn't update the gh-pages

1. you have to update your gh-pages and then
2. push gh-pages again

update gh-pages
push gh-pages again

That's why it's important push to master

you will need to update branches
update your branch is very simple

- update from master

master is ahead of gh-pagaes
when you update from master, they will be on the same point.

# 1. master 2. gh-pages

You need to know about gh-pages

- [x] You need index.html or it's not going to work.
- [ ] The folder name is case sensitive. ex) Images or Css
- [ ] gh-pages is very sensitive and strict.

1. Create a branch "gh-pages"
2. Push the branch
3. Go back to master and change whatever you want and commit
4. Go back to gh-pages
5. update from master
6. push gh-pages

7) go to master branch and change your code and commit
8) go to gh-pages branch and then update from master branch
9) At the end, you push gh-pages and master
