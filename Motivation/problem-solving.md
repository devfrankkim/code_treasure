## Step for problems solving

Helping others really helps reinforce learning and being able to seek help is great for speeding up progress

### 1. Understand
```
Know exactly what is being asked. 

Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 

(hence why this is the first step).

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).
```
### 2. Plan
```
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
```
### 3. Dive
```
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

Connecting all your *“sub-solutions”* will give you the solution to the original problem.

Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started
```
### 4. Stuck?
```
First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this *debugging* (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

> “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

- Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew.
- Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.
- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).
- Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.
