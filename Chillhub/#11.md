# split & /|W+/ & filter 
The split() method turns a String into an array of strings
The \w metacharacter is used to find a word character
A word character is a character from a-z, A-Z, 0-9, including the _ (underscore) character.
```
split(/\w+/).filter(word=> word.length)

var b = "I am  Frank ";
b.split(/\W+/); // ["I", "am", "Frank", ""]

b.split(/\W+/).filter(word=> word.length); // ["I", "am", "Frank"]
```
