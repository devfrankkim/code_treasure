# Object Destructuring

```
const human = {
    name: "Frank",
    lastName: "Kim",
    nationality: "MARS",
    favFood: {
        breakfast: carrots,
        lunch: garlic,
        dinner: onion
    }
};

#1
const name = human.name;
const lastName = human.lastName;
const nationality = human.nationality;
console.log(name, lastName, nationality);


#2 
const {name, lastName} = human 
// const {take the property of an object} = whichObject

** Hey go inside of whichObject and then take the variables 
and then create variables with the value**


#3
//const differentName = human.nationality
const {nationality: differentName} = human 
**
Hey go to the Object(human) and then take the nationality variable and then give the value to 'differentName'
**

console.log(name, lastName)

#4
const dinner = human.favFood.dinner
const {favFood: {breakfast, lunch, dinner}} = human 

#IMPORTANT
nationality: garlic => change the variable name to 'garlic'
favFood: {onion, olives} => go inside the brackets('Object')

```
