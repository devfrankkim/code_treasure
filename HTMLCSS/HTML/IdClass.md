# What is id? what is class?

How do I know which header is which without names?
ex) How do people recongnize twins?

'id' is very unique. it's like passport number. (no-share)
'class' is like country, the same class rooms. (share)

```
<body>
    <section>
        <header id="headerNumberone" class="defaultHeader">
            <h1>Title of a section</h1>
        </header>
    </section>
    <div>
      <header id="differentHeader" class="defaultHeader">Title of the unknown container</header>
    </div>
</body>
```
