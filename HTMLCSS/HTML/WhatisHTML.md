# HTML - Hypertext Mark up language

```
This part is important. You mark it up.
ex) This is the title, this is the link, we highlight something

Hey man, this is title. this is header. this is footer. this is navigation.
we do these with HTML.

<!DOCTYPE html>
This just tells the browsers that this is html (self contained /)

<head> is invisible for users.

information => head
Contents => body

<meta> means extra information.

<meta charset="utf-8">
character encoding
ex) your website has different languages
This tells you what kind of characters you are going to write.

<meta name="description" content="welcome to my club">
You won't find this anywhere on the webpage.
but this works when you google it. This shows the description of the webpage.

<meta name="author" content="Frank Kim">

```
