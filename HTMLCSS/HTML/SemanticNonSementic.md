# Semantic & non-Semantic

[reference for Semantic](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

_span is a container for 'text'_

```
semantic means something.

<span> means short. </span>
<section>This is important</section>
<article>This is important</article>
<header>This is important</header>
```

```
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
```

```
       <header>
         <nav>
    <section><aside>
    <article><aside>
       <footer>
```

```
The <section> element defines a section in a document.
A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
```

```
<section>
  <h1>WWF</h1>
  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is....</p>
</section>
```

```
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

- Forum post
- Blog post
- Newspaper article
```
