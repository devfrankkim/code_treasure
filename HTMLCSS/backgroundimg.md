background-repeat: no-repeat

# contain => same as 100%

```
It will always fit within the container based on the height or width

No matter of the height of the box, the image will always fit inside perfectly.
```

# cover (banner) opossite of contain

```
cover always makes sure it coveres the entire container box.
the image is not shrinking like **contain**

so the image fills the whole container as usual but it only shows the amount of height you set. You can even show specific parts of the image using background-position

ex )background-position: center left
```
