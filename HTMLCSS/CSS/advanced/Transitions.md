# what is Transitions?

[reference for transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)

```
Make our state transitions look better
You need to set specific property when giving transition.

ex) transition: background-color 0.1s ease-in-out;

But you wanna change all property settings?

then put all
ex) transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out


Transition works better with focus, active and hover
