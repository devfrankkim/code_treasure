# How to connect with HTML

1. inline and this sucks.
   why? because you will have many pages. This will take longer time.

2. external (this is better)

```
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <style>
    body{
        background-color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <body>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
    <a href="#">Fake link</a>
  </body>
```

Question!

Having internal styles in the < head > is very efficient and will save me a lot of time

1.Yes, why not?
2.Nah. It's a bad idea
