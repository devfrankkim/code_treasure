# Class - this

We are using classes, which is object oriented programming. 'this' means 'the current class'

```
import React from "react";
import axios from "axios";

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    isLoading: true,
  };
  getMovies = async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get("https://yts.mx/api/v2/list_movies.json");
    console.log(data);
  };
  componentDidMount() {
    this.getMovies(); // this means 'the current class' because of 'class' which is object oriented programming 
  }

  render() {
    return <div>{`${this.state.isLoading ? "Loading..." : "Ready"}`}</div>;
  }
}

export default App;

```
