#Blocking vs None-Blocking (Event Loop)

JS is Never blocking

if JS was blocking language,
there's input
and user is using it and happy.

when a user inputs his/her name
the user wouldn't be able to keep typing.

because JS will be busy handling the fetch to the API.
that will be blocking.
That means, JS can only do one thing at a time.
This includes user input, event, fetch and etc..

so if JS was blocking then it would be complicated to do anything on websites.

BUT
**alert** is blocking function
```
alert('whatsup?');
console.log('nothing much');
```

then you can't do anything. It will only show alert function.

That's why JS is amazing because we can use callbacks and Events

Add Event listener click, and JS will wait for the click to happen.

so where does everything go?
ex)

```
setTimeout( () => console.log('haha'), 3000)
```

where does the console.log go? and how does this happen?
What comes first then?

```
setTimeout( () => console.log('second'), 0)
console.log('first')
```

Call Stack is tracking what JS needs to do.

ex)

```
1. setTimeout( () => console.log('second'), 0)
2. console.log('first');
```

```
*Stack
console.log('first');

*Web API
setTimeout()

*Queue
console.log('second')
```

스택에 아무것도 없을 경우에만, 자바스크립트는 메세지 Queue 있는 것을 가지고 간다.
**_When there's nothing inside Stack, JS will send something from Queue to Stack._**

ex) Fetch

1. Stack
2. Web API(After calling website)
3. the function will go to Queue
4. When JS is ready, JS sends the function to Stack
5. Execute the function

```
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    isLoading: true
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("before isLoading is false");
      this.setState({ isLoading: false });
       console.log("after 3sec rendering");
    }, 3000);
  }

  render() {
    console.log("rendering");
     const { isLoading } = this.state;
    return <div>{`${this.state.isLoading ? "Loading..." : "Ready"}`}</div>;
  }
}

export default App;
```
