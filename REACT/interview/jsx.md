### JSX takes care of XSS.

- XSS - Cross site scripting (XSS) is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted application or website. Attackers often initiate an XSS attack by sending a malicious link to a user and enticing the user to click it.

- React Element is returning an Object.
- React Component is a function that returns JSX, or a react element, or a function.

### Syntax When rendering:

- For React Element: root.render(element_name);
- For React Component : root.render(<ComponentName />);

`React.createElement ⇒ gives you an Object ⇒ Converts and render ⇒  converts it to HTML (DOM) `

### Who understands the javaScript code? → Babel

### React worked with Babel team together for converting the syntax
