### From Abacus to Analytical Engine

- To put it simply, a computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations
  
- Before we had actual computer devices, the term computer was used to refer to someone who actually did the calculation.

- In life, it is important to know where we've been in order to understand where we are and where we are going

- Historical context can help you understand why things work the way they do today.   

- In the technology industry, having a little context can go a long way to making sense of the concepts you'll encounter.

- An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems.


### The Path to Modern Computers

- When the war broke out, governments started pouring money and resources into computing research. They wanted to help develop technologies that would give them advantages over other countries, lots of efforts were spun up and advancements were made in fields like cryptography.

- Cryptography is the art of writing and solving codes

- During the war, computers were used to process secret messages from enemies faster than a human could ever hope to do.

- The enigma machine was a German military invention. Alan Turing was instead a key part of the team that cracked the machine.

- Earlier, they had huge machines to read data and racks of vacuum tubes that help move that data.

- vacuum tubes control the electricity voltages and all sorts of electronic equipment like televisions and radios, but these specific vacuum tubes were bulky and broke all the time.

- `Imagine what the work of an I.T. support specialist was like in those early days of computing.`

- The job description might have included crawling around inside huge machines filled with dust and creepy crawly things, or replacing vacuum tubes and swapping out those punch cards. 
  
- In those days, doing some debugging might have taken on a more literal meaning. 

- Eventually, the industry started using transistors to control electricity voltages. 

- This is now a fundamental component of all electronic devices.

- Transistors perform almost the same functions as vacuum tubes but they are more compact and more efficient. You can easily have billions of transistors in a small computer chip today. 

- We no longer have to learn how to write machine code in ones and zeros.

HUGE computers -> Apple -> Microsoft(with IBM) 
Microsft

- For decades it was the preferred operating system in the workplace and dominated the computing industry because it could be run on any compatible hardware.

- a new type of computing was emerging: video games. During the 1970s and 80s, coin-operated entertainment machine called arcades became more and more popular

- Video games have contributed to the evolution of computers in a very real way


### UNIX - GNU - LINUX(Open source)

- GNU didn't evolve into a full operating system, but it set a foundation for the formation of one of the largest open source operating system, Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds.

### PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) 90s



### Complier - Transpiler 




- Compilers made it possible to translate human language via a programming language into `machine code`.

- Compiler is a tool that translates source code written in high-level programming language to another low-level language (`object code, bytecode, machine code`).

- Transpiler (also called source-to-source compiler or transcompiler) is a tool that translates source code between high-level languages.

- While a compiler takes our code and turns it into something lower-level than what we wrote your code in originally, a transpiler is different. A transpiler takes our code and turns it into...more of the same code at the same high-level we started off with.

- Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code.

- Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once, before program runs, whereas an Interpreter coverts each high-level program statement, one by one, into the machine code, during program run. Compiled code runs faster while interpreted code runs slower.

- Compiler displays all errors after compilation, on the other hand, the Interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.
- Compiler takes an entire program whereas the Interpreter takes a single line of code.

- For Compiler, Errors are displayed after entire program is checked
- For Interpreter, Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted if any.
```
Source Code -> Complier -> Machine code -> Output
Source Code -> Interpreter -> Output
```

```
Compiler - compiles code to a lower level code.

Example:

"Developer code" -> "Machine code"
PHP -> C
Java -> bytecode
Transpiler - compiles code to same level of code/abstraction.

Example:

"Developer code" -> "Another developer code or version"
JavaScript ES2015+ -> JavaScript ES5
Interpreter - interprets code, not really in the same class/league/context with the two above.

Example: php.exe

"Your PHP code/scripts inside index.php" -> "Results to html or just like pure index.html"

```


###  Punch cards -> magnetic tapes(ex:vinyl records or cassette tapes)
- if you dropped the punch cards, it was impossible to sort the data again.


### Question 
- What cards had holes in them that were historically used to store data?
