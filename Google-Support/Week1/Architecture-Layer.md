### Abstraction

- When we interact with our computers we use our mouse, keyboard or even a touch screen. We don't tell it the actual zeros and ones it needs to understand something. But wait, we actually do.

- We use the concept of abstraction to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.

- If you buy a car from a different manufacturer, you operate it in pretty much the same way even though the stuff under the hood might be completely different.

- This is the essence of abstraction. Abstraction hides complexity by providing a common interface, the steering wheel, pedals, gear stick, and gauges in our car example.


- The same thing happens in our computer. We don't need to know how works underneath the hood


- Thanks to abstractions, the average computer user doesn't have to worry about the technical details.

- `In computing, we use abstraction to make a very complex problem, like how to make computers work, easier to think about`
  
- `We do that by breaking it apart into simpler ideas that describe single concepts or individual jobs that need to be done, and then stack them in layers.`
  
- One other simple example of abstraction in an IT role that you might see a lot is an error message
  
- We don't have to dig through someone else's code and find a bug. 

- This has been abstracted out for us already in the form of an error message.

- `A simple error message like file not found actually tells us a lot of information and saves us time to figure out a solution.` 

- Can you imagine if instead of abstracting an error message our computer did nothing and we had no clue where to start looking for answers? 

- Abstraction helps us in many ways that we don't even realize.


### Computer Architecture Overview

- Since you're stepping into the world of IT, you do need to understand all the layers of a computer and how they work. 


- It's essential that you understand how the different pieces interact so you can resolve any issue that may arise.

- A computer can be cut into four main layers, hardware, operating system, software, and users.


**Hardware, Operating System, Software, User**


- The user interacts with the computer and she can do more than that. She can operate, maintain, and even program the computer.


- While we work with computers every day, it is the user interaction that makes up most of our job, from responding to user emails to fixing their computers


- People just want to know whether or not you can fix the problem. 
  
- Make sure you have strong fundamentals.

TCP/IP Model / OSI Model

- TCP defines how applications can create communication channels across a network. IP defines the way each packet is addressed and routed to ensure it reaches the correct destination (TCP가 데이터의 추적을, IP가 배달을 처리한다고 보면 된다)

1. Application Layer(HTTP)
2. Transport Layer(port-packet-deliver)
3. Internet Layer (packet push to Internet. Using IP has origin and destination information)
4. Network Layer (packet sent to Network)


### Fix their problems and support users. Best way for me and them.



### Question 2

- Write a paragraph on examples of abstraction that you encounter in your day-to-day life. For example, driving a car is an example of abstraction, you don't need to understand how a car works underneath the hood in order to drive one.

- It's amazing how often we use abstraction in our daily lives, without even realizing it. Thank you for submitting your response to this prompt. I encourage you to think of other ways you use abstraction in your daily routine. This habit will help as you prepare to become an IT Support Specialist!
