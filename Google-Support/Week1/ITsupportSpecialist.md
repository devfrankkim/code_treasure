#  IT Support Specialist 

- But in general, an IT support specialist makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly.
- This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment. 
- Not only will you learn the technical aspects of troubleshooting a problem, you'll also learn how to communicate with users in order to best assist them.
- For me, my favorite part of IT support is the problem solving aspect.
-  I love to exercise my creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue.
-  Plus, when things go wrong or you fail at something in IT, you can take the feedback from those mistakes and be better equipped to tackle them the next time around.


## Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life.

- I love the process of problem solving and constantly stretching myself to learn and grow.


- A big part of being successful in an IT role is the ability to be a self-led learner -- someone who finds key resources and reads up on the latest tech trends and solutions.
