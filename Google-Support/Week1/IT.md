## Information Technology

- The use of digital technology, like computers and Internet, to store and process data into useful information.

- It's really about people. It's not just computer stuff.
- That's the heart and soul of IT support work.
- What good is technology of information if people can't even use technology or make sense of information?
- IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology.
- It's about changing the world through the ways we collaborate, share and create together.


- Growing skills gap is known as the digital divide.
- People like us are the real solution to birdging the digital divide.
- Not only involves confroting and understanding the combination of socio economic factors that shape our experience but also helping others confront and understand those experiences.
- When I think about solving the digital divide, I can't help but think of all the opportunities and breakouts that folks from diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the industry can bring.
- By brining more people of color, more women, more ethnically diverse people into the IT fields, 
  we are bound to see unique new ideas and products that we haven't even begun to imagine that benefits everybody.
