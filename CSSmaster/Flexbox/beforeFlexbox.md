# Before Flexbox

when you learn technology,  
It's always important to understand.  
what problems the technology can solve!

```
Block is an element that doesn't allow any elements next to it.
Each box has a huge margin.

it allows divs to remain blocks but they can be next to each other.
display: inline-block;

inline vs inline-block

inline is not boxes
inlines are elements that are fluid
they don't have width and height. they are on the same line
ex) text is inline
text is not a box
You can't use inline with width and height

display: inline-block
we have block properties
block can have width and height because it's a box.
and blocks next to each other.

but the problem is there will be weird spaces

```
