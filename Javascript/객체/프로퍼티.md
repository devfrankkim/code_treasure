- **Dot notation is faster to write and clearer to read.**
- **Square bracket notation allows access to properties containing special characters and selection of properties using variables**

- Another example of characters that can't be used with dot notation is property names that themselves contain a dot.

```js
// Another example of characters that can't be used with dot notation is property names that themselves contain a dot.

// For example a json response could contain a property called bar.Baz.

var foo = myResponse.bar.Baz; // incorrect syntax
var foo = myResponse["bar.Baz"]; // correct syntax
```

```js
// Given:
var foo = { bar: "baz" };

// Then
var x = foo["bar"];

// vs.
var x = foo.bar;
```

```js
// Square bracket notation allows the use of characters that can't be used with dot notation:

var foo = myForm.foo[]; // incorrect syntax
var foo = myForm["foo[]"]; // correct syntax

// Secondly, square bracket notation is useful when dealing with property names which vary in a predictable way:

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  someFunction(myForm["myControlNumber" + i]);
}
```

```js
// The bracket notation allows you to access properties by name stored in a variable:
var obj = { abc: "hello" };
var x = "abc";
var y = obj[x];
console.log(y); //output - hello

// obj.x would not work in this case.
```
