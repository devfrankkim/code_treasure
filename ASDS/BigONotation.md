## Big-O Notation - the worse case

- The worst case complexity of an algorithmn is represented using the Big-O notation.
- Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms.

* expressed in terms of the input
* focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details

## Big-O Time complexity O(n)

- Time complexity is dependent on the input size.
- as the size of the input increases -> time complexity also increases

=====

Linear (n - loop)
constant time complexity (n - excuted only once)

space complexity constant 알고리즘 - extra memory 필요하지 않다.
